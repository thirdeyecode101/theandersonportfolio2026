This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my technical mastery and dedication to the IT field. My objective is to bridge the gap between generalized IT support and specialized engineering, utilizing a diverse toolkit to solve complex infrastructure challenges.

🛠 Technical Specializations
Networking: Design, configuration, and troubleshooting of LAN/WAN, VLANs, and VPN protocols.

Cloud Solutions: Deployment and management within AWS/Azure environments, focusing on high availability and security.

Project Management: Lifecycle management of IT deployments, ensuring efficiency, documentation, and stakeholder alignment.

📂 Featured Projects
[Project Name 1]: Mastery of Networking – (Packet Tracer Labs, Solo Projects and Badges).

[Project Name 2]: Cloud Infrastructure Deployment – (Classroom AWS/Azure/GCP projects).

[PATHSYNC AI]: IT Operations Framework – (Project Management).

📈 Career Goal & Dedication
I am actively pursuing a career as an IT Technician, committed to continuous learning. I believe in a "Full-Stack Infrastructure" approach—meaning I am as comfortable troubleshooting a hardware workstation as I am configuring a virtualized cloud network.
